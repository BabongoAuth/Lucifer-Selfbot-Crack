No. This is a screenshot before the file was encryped, if you do it now, results will be different because of the encryption method.

The bot actually gets your token for you, so there is no reason to do the steps below unless the token detection doesnt work. (suprisingly baba does not log the tokens)


How to do it manually:

1. Go to discord
2. Click CTRL, Shift and i at the same time
Once doing this a white or black box at the right side of your discord should pop up.
3. On the top, click the little double arrow at the top, to the right of "Network"
4. In the drop down, click "Application"
5. In the sub category where it says "Storage", click the drop down on "Local Storage"
6. Scroll down all the way in the little table it opens
7. Do control + r
This will restart your discord. We need to get discord to send your token to the auth server again so we can get it and save it so the selfbot can send messages, etc.
8. At the bottom of a table, a new column should appear called "token". Double click into the "Value" column and then copy it. (You will have about five seconds to do this before it dissapears.)

Note: You will need to deactivate 2-Step because if you don't the bot will not be able to send messages, only read them

If you go to the config.json, you are able to set your prefix.
Your prefix is the character you have to type in order for the bot to know you are talking to it.

To make a webhook make a channel, then click the channel settings, go to webhooks, create one, copy the link and paste it in the selfbot config.json under what you want the selfbot to log to. For example, I would create a channel for nitro logs, and a webhook for the channel, then paste the link under where it says nitro sniper webhook link.
